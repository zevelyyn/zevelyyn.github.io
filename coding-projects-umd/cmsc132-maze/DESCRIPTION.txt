CMSC 132 - Object Oriented Programming II

Language: Java

Project Description:
This project solves randomly generated mazes three different ways - First converting the maze into a graph, and then applying one of the standard graph algorithms:

1. Depth-First-Search
2. Breadth-First-Search
3. Dijsktra's Algorithm (to find the path from "start" to "end" that uses edges with a minimal total cost)
